# TREND

> Returns values along a linear trend

## Syntax
=TREND(known_y's, [known_x's], [new_x's], [const])The TREND function syntax has the following arguments:ArgumentDescriptionknown_y'sRequiredThe set of y-values you already know in the relationship y = mx + bIf the array known_y's is in a single column, then each column of known_x's is interpreted as a separate variable.If the array known_y's is in a single row, then each row of known_x's is interpreted as a separate variable.known_x'sOptionalAn optional set of x-values that you may already know in the relationship y = mx + bThe array known_x's can include one or more sets of variables. If only one variable is used, known_y's and known_x's can be ranges of any shape, as long as they have equal dimensions. If more than one variable is used, known_y's must be a vector (that is, a range with a height of one row or a width of one column).If known_x's is omitted, it is assumed to be the array {1,2,3,...} that is the same size as known_y's.new_x'sOptionalNew x-values for which you want TREND to return corresponding y-valuesNew_x's must include a column (or row) for each independent variable, just as known_x's does. So, if known_y's is in a single column, known_x's and new_x's must have the same number of columns. If known_y's is in a single row, known_x's and new_x's must have the same number of rows.If you omit new_x's, it is assumed to be the same as known_x's.If you omit both known_x's and new_x's, they are assumed to be the array {1,2,3,...} that is the same size as known_y's.constOptionalA logical value specifying whether to force the constant b to equal 0If const is TRUE or omitted, b is calculated normally.If const is FALSE, b is set equal to 0 (zero), and the m-values are adjusted so that y = mx.
